# AI based Pesticide spraying drone using CNN

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to develop a smart pesticide-spraying drone. The drone is designed to detect diseases and pests in crops using image processing and then spray pesticides precisely, reducing chemical usage and improving crop health.

## Features

- **Disease and Pest Detection:** Utilizes CNN models to analyze leaf images and identify diseases or pest infestations.
- **Automated Spraying:** Integrates with drone flight controllers for targeted pesticide application.
- **Efficient Resource Usage:** Reduces unnecessary pesticide spraying by focusing only on affected areas.
